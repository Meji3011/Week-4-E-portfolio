# Week-4-E-portfolio
Following FES Week 4's video on making an E-portfolio website, adding personal elements and altercations.

This website took about 2 days worth of time to implement as there are a lot of new concepts introduced, such as many
JS functions and the emailJS hook implemented. Learned about the basics of implementing loading states and success states.

It was a fun guided project to follow.

Finished the backbone of the portfolio website. Need to work on the following:
1. Update resume and add to asset folder, fix associated links that leads to the resume.
2. Add projects to the site and update the project section.
3. Find a way to add a picture of myself to the website without drastically disrupting the flow.
4. Double-check responsiveness and make sure all links are working.
5. Add personal touches and styling to the website, maybe try Abel for font over Roboto?
